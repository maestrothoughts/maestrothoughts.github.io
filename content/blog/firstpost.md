My primary motivation to create this website was to have an excuse to write and post this article.

One thing that my favorite dance music does is play with structure.

## An Example of Traditional Structure

Many dance songs, especially house songs, start with 8 bars of a repeating musical phrase, followed by the beat kicking in. An example of this would be one of my favorite songs of all time, Music Sounds Better with You.

Most songs in this style have a similar structure, the beat kicking in after exactly 8 bars. As a result, listeners learn to expect this structure. However, some songs deliberately use this expectation to create surprise, to amazing (imo) results.

## Nontraditional Example 1: Daft Punk

Daft Punk were the first artist in which I consciously noticed this exploitation of expectations. My favorite example is Indo Silver Club, off their debut album Homework.

Like Music Sounds Better With You, the song starts with a looped phrase for 8 bars (there's an extra one at the beginning, but it's quiet enough to not feel like the true start of the song). The looped phrase consists of a piano that plays two low notes, then a few higher notes. Before the drop kicks in, it feels like the downbeat (first beat of each bar) is that first low note. So, if we count 8 bars with the first low note in mind as the downbeat, we expect the drop to start on bar 9 beat 1.

However, once we reach bar 9 beat 1, the drop doesn't hit.

The song didn't follow our expected timing; there's a split second of uncertainty.

Then we reach bar 9 beat 2, and the drop hits.

In this moment, the downbeat is revealed to be actually on the second low note.

In my opinion, this is hard as fuck. The song instantly gains an extra level of groove that sustains itself through the rest of the song.

## Nontraditional Example 2: Charli XCX

It should go without saying that Charli XCX is objectively a modern GOAT. As a result, it is unsurprising that one of her singles also plays with traditional dance music structural expectations.

Traditional song structures teach us to expect the drop to hit when Charli sings the "go" in "I always let the good ones go". However, as with Indo Silver Club, once she starts singing "go", no drop starts. There's a moment of uncertainty, but this time it lasts a full bar as Charli stretches out that "go", after which the drop kicks in.

## Nontraditional Example 3: Fred again..

Fred again.. went on a generational tour run with Skrillex and Four Tet, culminating in the release of "Baby again..".

To my ears, this song is essentially an extended build up to a final drop, and starting from 3:59, it really starts gearing up for that drop to hit. The expected timing for the drop is after 8 bars; as can be expected from the first 2 examples, 8 bars go by and the drop doesn't hit. This time, it continues for another 2 bars. By the end of those 2 extra bars, we start to think maybe the drop isn't supposed to hit after 8 bars of buildup, but actually after 16 bars (traditional song structure dictates multiples of 8 feel the most correct). However, immediately after that, the drop hits on bar 11. It doesn't hurt that the bass is monstrous to heighten the effect.
