<p>My primary motivation to create this website was to have an excuse to write and post this article.</p>
<p>One thing that my favorite dance music does is play with structure.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-of-traditional-structure">An Example of Traditional Structure</h2>
<p>Many dance songs, especially house songs, start with 8 bars of a repeating musical phrase, followed by the beat kicking in. An example of this would be one of my favorite songs of all time, Music Sounds Better with You.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQlAEiCb8m0?si=xQjnGRa8RhHj1Y6B" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Most songs in this style have a similar structure, the beat kicking in after exactly 8 bars. As a result, listeners learn to expect this structure. However, some songs deliberately use this expectation to create surprise, to amazing (imo) results.</p>
<h2 id="nontraditional-example-1-daft-punk">Nontraditional Example 1: Daft Punk</h2>
<p>Daft Punk were the first artist in which I consciously noticed this exploitation of expectations. My favorite example is Indo Silver Club, off their debut album Homework.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VubH7FuW6TQ?si=G52PPd0uGf3FrfcI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Like Music Sounds Better With You, the song starts with a looped phrase for 8 bars (there's an extra one at the beginning, but it's quiet enough to not feel like the true start of the song). The looped phrase consists of a piano that plays two low notes, then a few higher notes. Before the drop kicks in, it feels like the downbeat (first beat of each bar) is that first low note. So, if we count 8 bars with the first low note in mind as the downbeat, we expect the drop to start on bar 9 beat 1.</p>
<p>However, once we reach bar 9 beat 1, the drop doesn't hit.</p>
<p>The song didn't follow our expected timing; there's a split second of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Then we reach bar 9 beat 2, and the drop hits.</p>
<p>In this moment, the downbeat is revealed to be actually on the second low note.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is hard as fuck. The song instantly gains an extra level of groove that sustains itself through the rest of the song.</p>
<h2 id="nontraditional-example-2-charli-xcx">Nontraditional Example 2: Charli XCX</h2>
<p>It should go without saying that Charli XCX is objectively a modern GOAT. As a result, it is unsurprising that one of her singles also plays with traditional dance music structural expectations.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjAuUXdSFaM?si=ghrrTT8VN_HkzLJo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Traditional song structures teach us to expect the drop to hit when Charli sings the &quot;go&quot; in &quot;I always let the good ones go&quot;. However, as with Indo Silver Club, once she starts singing &quot;go&quot;, no drop starts. There's a moment of uncertainty, but this time it lasts a full bar as Charli stretches out that &quot;go&quot;, after which the drop kicks in.</p>
<h2 id="nontraditional-example-3-fred-again">Nontraditional Example 3: Fred again..</h2>
<p>Fred again.. went on a generational tour run with Skrillex and Four Tet, culminating in the release of &quot;Baby again..&quot;.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNkAqLMOhdA?si=dyl2l22pMDKjCabP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  
<p>To my ears, this song is essentially an extended build up to a final drop, and starting from 3:59, it really starts gearing up for that drop to hit. The expected timing for the drop is after 8 bars; as can be expected from the first 2 examples, 8 bars go by and the drop doesn't hit. This time, it continues for another 2 bars. By the end of those 2 extra bars, we start to think maybe the drop isn't supposed to hit after 8 bars of buildup, but actually after 16 bars (traditional song structure dictates multiples of 8 feel the most correct). However, immediately after that, the drop hits on bar 11. It doesn't hurt that the bass is monstrous to heighten the effect.</p>
